# Game of Life by Boris

was implemented after the Code Retreat 2015 @ Softwerkskammer  (http://www.meetup.com/Software-Craftsmanship-Meetup-Softwerkskammer-Munchen/events/224329870)
but before the JS CodeRetreat Munich #8 by Wolfram (http://www.meetup.com/JavaScript-CodeRetreat/events/225825955)

no code, only knowledge from the coderetreats was used

a playground to run the implementation and tests without a need to pull/install anything is going to be accessible for some time at http://spirina-translation.de/js
